This game is all about learning the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana!  Make progress by finding the right matches for the Latin alphabet and earn cool upgrades in the process which will help you learn even faster.

While still in early development and only a side-project, we decided to make this game open source to connect with the community and share learnings as well as learn from others. If you want to contribute, feel free to do so, we're looking forward to it!
